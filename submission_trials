#SBATCH --job-name=NickelatesTrial ## this helps identify your job in the queue, especially if you have multiple
#SBATCH --ntasks=1 ## this is the number of nodes you are using. unless you are skilled in using MPI for across-nodes parallelization, this is usually 1

#####SBATCH --nodes=1                       # Use 1 node

#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=28 ## this is the number of cores you are using on a given node. LISA has 28 cores per node.

#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4GB       # Memory (RAM) per core. this is the memory per core. sometimes you need more memory: the total memory per node is 128GB, and mem-per-core * cores < 128 GB for obvious reasons. if you need more memory, you will have to use less cores.
