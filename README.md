# Hartree Fock Solver and Itterator motivated by MIT in rare earth Nickelates

## Features:
- HFA Solver: iterates MFP guesses based on multiple ansatz techniques
- Diagram sweeper to solve for phase diagrams
- 1D cut to study the effect of a single parameter
- Meta Diagram: To track the change of one phase with two parameters varying

## Single point itteration:
(most with or without HFA, arbitrary BZ code in progress)
- Fermi surface(2D)
- Bandstructure spaghetti plot
- convergence tracking of the mfp evolution
- state projections on density of states

## To use:
Go to examples folders, tutorials are there for most computations. simply paste a script onto the main folder
